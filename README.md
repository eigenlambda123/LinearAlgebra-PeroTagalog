# Linear Algebra: Pero Tagalog

This project is a **personal notes website** for studying Linear Algebra.  
It is built using **MkDocs** with the **Material for MkDocs** theme, and integrates **MathJax** for rendering LaTeX math formulas.  

The main goal is to create clean, well-structured notes in Tagalog that can be easily accessed through the browser.

## Features
- **Material for MkDocs Theme** – modern, responsive, and easy-to-navigate UI.
- **MathJax Integration** – renders LaTeX math formulas beautifully.
- **Custom Styling (CSS)** – improves readability and highlights key definitions.
- **Built-in Search** – quickly find topics in your notes.
- **Lightweight & Markdown-Based** – write notes in Markdown, render them as a website.

---

## Tech Stack
- **MkDocs** – static site generator for documentation.
- **Material for MkDocs** – theme providing navigation, tabs, and styling.
- **Markdown** – content format for writing notes.
- **MathJax** – LaTeX rendering for math equations.
- **CSS3** – custom styling.

## How to Run

1. **Install MkDocs and dependencies** (Python required):
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

2. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

3. **Build the static site** (optional, for deployment):

   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

   This will generate a `site/` folder with the compiled website.

## Future Improvements

* Add navigation between chapters (sidebar or menu).
* Dark mode for better readability.
* Export notes as **PDF**.
* Add interactivity (vector visualizations using JS).
